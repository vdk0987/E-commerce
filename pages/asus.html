      ABOUT ROG RX RED SWITCH - Linear and Swift, ROG RX Red Optical Mechanical
      Switches are the first to be developed by ROG. Extensive research, testing
      and fine-tuning have resulted in switches with a 1.5mm actuation point for
      lightning-fast inputs. An initial force of 40g prevents accidental
      keystrokes, and goes all the way up to 55g for perfect rebound feedback.
      ROG RX Red switches provide a smooth and linear feel to give you near
      instantaneous response the moment you strike the key.

      water resistance, ensuring it’s well-protected from spills and dust. It
